MingPao RSS generator
===================

It is a small piece of PHP code which crawl and parse webpage content from MingPao, a well-known newspaper in Hong Kong.

- gen_rss.php - the core of the generator. Plain PHP without framework. Just works (for me still)
- ganon.php - Ganon Library to parse HTML
- update.sh - while-loop bash script to update feed at 7am
- mingpao.supervisor.conf - supervisor configuration file to ensure the news feed is updated

Remark:
It assumes those files are installed in /var/www/mingpao/ (public accessible) and writeable for user pi.
